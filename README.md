## POS and KDS for a Business

Summary

The first part would contain a menu/ordering system where client can view the menus on
their mobile/tablet and take order from their customer. The menu/POS system webpage displays the food or drinks menu and point of sale display. Clicking on the menu of the nav bar will bring users to the food/drink menu page. The menu page has two sections.
• The left section on the screen will have types of meals such as combo, entrée, drinks, and list of each etc.
• The right section on the screen will display the Check-Out and payment for the added items.

The second part is to build KDS. KDS will have its nav bar next to menu. When the
owner takes an order and processes the payment system using their device, KDS should receive
the order information. KDS has a box/ container where all the orders are lined up side by side
from top to bottom of the screen. The order information will contain a list of food items, order
number, time, etc., of the order and display the information under a table with one column per
order. The heading for the column is the order number followed by food items in that list. KDS
also shows a “Ready” button at the bottom of each order table. Clicking the button will remove
the orders that are ready to serve to customer.
